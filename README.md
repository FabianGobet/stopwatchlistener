# stopwatchlistener

This is a Windows application for a stopwatch that can be triggered using keybinds, without the need for focus on its window. 

This means you can trigger the stopwatch while using other applications. 

Furthermore, you can assign the key for which you want the stopwatch to be triggered with.
